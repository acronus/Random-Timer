## Random Timer

Random Timer is an app designed for party games and other situations where you need a countdown
that will expire after a randomized amount of time and without the participants knowing how much
time is remaining. Current features include:

 - Configurable maximum and minimum values, that will be used when randomly picking a starting time
 - A choice of notification methods, including an alert sound or vibration
 - Continuous mode, for quick back-to-back rounds of gaming
 - Easy to use, one-button interface
 - Clear visual notification when time is running or stopped
 - Dark or light theme
 
The most recent version of Random Timer is available [on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.eldarerathis.randomtimer).

## Building the source

You'll need [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html) to build Random Timer. 
It has the following dependencies, which `gradle` will attempt to pull in for you automagically:

 - android-support-v7-appcompat
 - [Android Bootstrap](https://github.com/Bearded-Hen/Android-Bootstrap)

You shouldn't need to do anything special; just clone the repo, open the project in Android Studio
and build.
